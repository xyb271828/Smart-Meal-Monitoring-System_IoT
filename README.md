# Smart-Meal-Monitoring-System_IoT
# Engineered an IoT system for elderly care, detecting dining tray pressure via ESP32 microcontroller.
# Implemented real-time ADC acquisition with threshold-based event detection and HTTP transfer to a Flask server, integrating haptic feedback for closed-loop response.
# Built API and dashboard to log timestamps, visualize meal duration, and issue alerts for delayed initiation.
